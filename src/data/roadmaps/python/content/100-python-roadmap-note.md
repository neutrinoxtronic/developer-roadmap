# Note

This roadmap specifically covers **Python and the ecosystem** around it. You can start from community selected [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) list to learn some topics that you are interested in. You will notice that it is missing things like version control, databases, software design, architecture and other things that are not directly related to Python; this is intentional. Have a look at the [Backend Roadmap](/backend) for a more comprehensive overview of the backend ecosystem.
